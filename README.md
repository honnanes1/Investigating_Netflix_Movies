# Investigating_Netflix_Movies
## Datacamp Project 
### Change in Duration Throughout the Years 
Welcome to my repository! This project is a part of my learning journey of Data Science in Python skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data. These foundational skills include several analytical modules of python such as NumPy Array, Matplotlib Plots, and Pandas Data Analysis library.
Mostly , in this project , I used several data analysis and manipulation techniques such as plottings, loopings, DataFrame filterings, etc on a Kaggle dataset file ti investigate whether or not movies in netflix are getting shorter or longer over time. My analysis revealed that the durations experienced an increase every year with occasional fluctuations.
This project helped me gain experience in an essential data science skill exploratory data analysis through visualization . This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.
